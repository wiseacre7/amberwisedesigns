# 3D Animation

This section is for 3D Animation projects I have done. These were completed in 3DS Max during my 3D Animation minor.

## Foam Fire Extinguisher
This clip uses a particle flow for the fire and for the extinghuisher, which extinguishes a burning EWU symbol.

## FlameThrower 
In contrast, this animation uses particle flow for fire instead. The flamethrower is following a spline path of my name, and leaves a texture in it's wake as my name 'burned' into the brick wall.
