# 3D Animation

This section is for 3D Animation projects I have done. These were completed in 3DS Max during my 3D Animation minor at EWU.

## Toys
A 20-second animation that I created with 3D-Modeled toys that begin chasing each other around the child's playroom. Here a couple interactions are shown, demonstrating cause-and-effect between the objects. This was my first ever animation.

## Foam Fire Extinguisher
This clip uses a particle flow for the fire and for the extinghuisher, which extinguishes a burning EWU symbol.

## FlameThrower 
In contrast, this animation uses particle flow for fire instead. The flamethrower is following a spline path of my name, and leaves a texture in it's wake as my name 'burned' into the brick wall.

## Chair Character Story
This project was for us to animate a usually inanimate object in order to give it character without relying on our usual instincts for how something should act. I was tasked with rigging a skeleton to the chair in order to make it able to 'walk', through which I was able to animate key-frames. The story follows a chair who is walking home from work, and passes by a bar. He begins to walk past, however changes his mind and walks in. Here, he finds that some of his chair-friends are already in the bar drinking, and decides to join them. The chair then stumbles home drunk after having a fun evening.

## Face/Voice Animation
For this project, we were asked to model and texture a self-portrait, then animate the mouth to match a sound clip of our own voice. The prompt for speech was "I love 3D Animation because..." followed by our own reasoning. In order to create the visual aspect of the model's speech, I modeled each of the distinct phonemes using the face/mouth and morphed into them each time they came up in my voice recording.
