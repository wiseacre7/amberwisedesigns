# Digital Art

Art of all mediums has always fascinated me. Digitally, I usually create through Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, etc.) or similar software. I do use traditional art mediums as well, however incorporating my art into a digital piece provides just as much fuel for my creativity. I enjoy the crisp lines, vibrant colors, and versatility that digital art is able to accomplish.


## Work Projects
These are some examples of the work I did at the printing and mailing company I most recently worked at. All identifying information and logos have been redacted or changed for client confidentiality.

### Billing Statement Design
My most recent line of work as a Graphic Designer involved creating mail pieces for clients. Sometimes, if they were unsure what they would like or only had a general idea, I would create an entirely new statement for them. The below pet license bill was created with just the prompt that they wanted an upgrade and a more modern looking statement.

### Newsletter Design
Some mail pieces we printed and mailed could include large newsletters. Below is a newsletter template I made from scratch for a client that wanted to portray a delicate, relaxing feel while remaining professional as a newsletter. I created the background vines as a vector using the pen tool, and was able to customize it to their specifications until the client was satisfied with the end result. The printed version is on an 11 x 17 sheet (duplex), folded in half as a booklet and included with their quarterly donation letters.

### Donor Letter Design
In some cases, I would be asked to create several different versions that clients could choose from. This client asked that I use their Anniversary logo as inspiration to make their donation letter background, as they were not sure how to design it themselves. I came up with several options, the top-left of which was chosen as the final version. I also keep cost-effective ink usage in mind when designing letters that will go out to a large number of people, which was the case with most of our mailings.

## Personal Projects
I also like to use my skills in my spare time, either for family and friends or for art I create as a gift.

### CookBook Project
As a personal project, my mom and her colleagues wanted to make a cook book as a retirement gift. The book would be comprised of some favorite recipes by all of the employees that he had worked with over the years. Since I am a designer, my mom asked if I would compile the recipes into a cook book that we could print ourselves and present to him in a binder. I was glad to be a part of something so special, so of course I jumped at the chance. The following are a few pages for examples.

## School Projects
These are some projects I created during my design classes as part of my minor in 3D Animation at Eastern Washington University.

### Circles / Squares
These images were created for my design class through Adobe Photoshop, meant to give the illusion of transparency without actually applying any transparent layers. All objects in the images were physically placed, and the opacity for every shape is 100%.

### Posterization - Pen Tool
As a Harry Potter fan, I took an image of one of the movie promotions and posterized it using Adobe Photoshop. I then imported it into Adobe Illustrator and used the pen tool, as well as a set pallet of colors, to trace the posterization into a new style.

### Interface Design
For my senior project at EWU, I was tasked with re-designing the interface for a check-in kiosk that would accept user information at EWU career fairs to print off nametags and track attendee statistics. These are several mockups I made through Adobe Photoshop and presented to my team, all before I started programming the actual interface. I also needed to make sure that the kiosk followed the [EWU Identity Standards](https://access.ewu.edu/Documents/MarComm/EWU_IdentityStandards14.pdf), as this was going to be used at official EWU events.

[//]: # (## Website Commissions)
[//]: # (### Bible Logo)
[//]: # "This is a commission I did recently for a colleague, who was designing a website for a client's religious study group. It was created through Illustrator with the pen tool. It is a vector to be infinitely scalable, and the background is easily adjusted as the pallet of the website has not been determined yet."
