# About Me

My name is Amber Wise. I am a Graphic Designer who has also worked in Software Development and Data Processing. I graduated from Eastern Washington University in 2016, where I earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in 3D Animation. This website exists to showcase some of my work in a portfolio for those that wish to view it. Feel free to look around!
